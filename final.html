   <h1>Best Website to learn html</h1> 
   <p>So this is my 2<sup>nd</sup> website. when I was learning and I stumbled across this website <a href="Https://w3schools.com"<button style="background-color: aqua;" width="10px" height="10px" > link to the website</button> </p></a> 
   <p>In this website I used the w3schools' website but remember that don't  go to this website if you are new and don't know anything about html 5. Then I reccomend this video if the video is not showing then search for html tutorial on google and click on the one posted by freecodecamp.org</p> 
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg&t=1336s" title="Html tutorial" alt="Search on google html tutorial " width="250" height="250" ></iframe>
      When you want to see the html in a website then left click on the thing you want to see and in the drop down list and select inspect 
      sample <button style= "button" style="background-color: red;" > sample</button> <!--this is a secret message that you can only see by using inspect but don't go inspecting everything-->
